# MNIST Digits Recognition Neural Network

This is my first neural netowrk. The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the concepts by creating a C++ program that can recognize hand written digits.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

A C++ Compiler such as GCC's G++


### Compiling

Open the project folder in terminal and execute "make".


### Executing

The binary will be called "network". To execute, run "./network".




## Built With

* [Ubuntu 18](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) - The OS used
* GCC 7.3.0 - GNU Compiling Collection version used


## Authors

* **Isaac Ault** - [isaacault](https://github.com/isaacault)
